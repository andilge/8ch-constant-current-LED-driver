Addeded lcsc.com part number where possible
trying to scope on pre building the board
excluded (not available, too expensive or better arrange locally)
- espP32 mini
- step down converter module 5V 1A
- 5A fast blowing glass fuse 5x20mm

Joined the free to use GPIOs, 5 Volt fused and ground header pins in one horizontal connector

Changed electrolyt condensators from smd to tht
More availablitiy, better prices and easier handling

Changed power inductor at led step down converters
Once again trying to improove performace and component availability, lower price and safe place on board

Improoved placement for led power components and optimized led power track routing

Usage of teardrops and smaller tracks for low power connections

Added ibom as help for component placement reference on board
